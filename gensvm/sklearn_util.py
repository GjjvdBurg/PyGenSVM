"""Functions in GenSVM that are taken from Scikit-Learn

The GenSVM Python package is designed to work in the same way as Scikit-Learn 
classifiers, as this makes it easier for people familiar with Scikit-Learn to 
use GenSVM. As such, some of the functionality of the GenSVM Python package is 
similar to code in the Scikit-Learn package (such as formatting the grid search 
results). To keep a clean separation between code from Scikit-Learn (which is 
licensed under the BSD license) and code written by the author(s) of the GenSVM 
package, the code from scikit-learn is placed here in explicit self-contained 
functions. To comply with clause a of the BSD license, it is repeated below as 
required.
